## Documentation, Installation, and Usage Instructions

### Laravel
Require this package in your composer.json and update composer. This will download the package and the laravel-gpt libraries also.

    composer require jonaspoelmans/laravel-gpt

## What It Does
This package allows you to connect by API to Large language Models such as OpenAI ChatGPT and Mistral.

Once installed you can do stuff like this:

```php
// Create your prompt for the LLM
$prompt = "Give me the list of 10 best PHP frameworks."

// Instantiate the Laravel GPT service
$laravelGPT = new LaravelGPTService();

// Retrieve a response from ChatGPT
$response = $laravelGPT->generateOpenAIResponse($prompt);
```

The response object is an associative array if the request went through or an empty string if an error occurred.

The parameters for the LLMs can be configured through the laravbelgpt.php config class.

```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

## Alternatives

- [Povilas Korop](https://twitter.com/@povilaskorop) did an excellent job listing the alternatives [in an article on Laravel News](https://laravel-news.com/two-best-roles-permissions-packages). In that same article, he compares laravel-permission to [Joseph Silber](https://github.com/JosephSilber)'s [Bouncer]((https://github.com/JosephSilber/bouncer)), which in our book is also an excellent package.
- [santigarcor/laratrust](https://github.com/santigarcor/laratrust) implements team support
- [ultraware/roles](https://github.com/ultraware/roles) (archived) takes a slightly different approach to its features.
- [zizaco/entrust](https://github.com/zizaco/entrust) offers some wildcard pattern matching
